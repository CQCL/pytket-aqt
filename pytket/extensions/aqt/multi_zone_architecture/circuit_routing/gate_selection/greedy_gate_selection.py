        The returned TrapConfiguration
        represents the "optimal" next state to implement the remaining gates in
        the depth list. The ordering of the qubits within the zones is arbitrary. The correct
        ordering will be determined at the qubit routing stage.

        Cycle through commands and assign qubits to new zones in order to implement them on
        a "first come, first served" basis

        Rules:

        - One qubit gates do not necessitate a move (until all 2 qubit gates are accounted for).
          If they cannot be performed in the current config, they can wait until that qubit
           requires a 2 qubit gate (or at the end of the circuit if no 2 qubit gates remain)
        - Two qubit gates will cause one or more moves to place the participating qubits into
           the same memory zone. Once the placement of a qubit is changed in order to implement
           a two qubit gate, it is "locked" in place. This means at some point, no more legal
           moves will be possible. The algorithm will terminate at that point and the current
           configuration will be emitted as the next config.

           Necessary moves may require the displacement of other qubits, due to max
           qubit requirements (using the "gate operation" maximum). This displacement is
           taken into account "lazily". Any qubits that have been displaced and were not involved
           in gates before termination will be placed in the "nearest" zones with available
           capacity
